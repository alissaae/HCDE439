            Above is the circuit that contains the IR reciever module and two LEDs, one red and one yellow, they each have a 220 ohm resistor. Not pictured is the IR remote that 
                communicates with the IR receiver module.

            <p>
            Above is the calculations for the type of resistor, 220, used and the schematic of the circuits used. 
            </p>
<p>
    Below is the Ardunio code that the board is using, fading the LEDs on and off red when 5 is pressed and yellow when 2 is pressed. They stay on for 1 second then turn off.

            Below is the final operation, the gif shows the 5 button being pressed on the IR remote, the red LED fading on, staying on for 1 second then turning off. Then the 2 button is pressed 
                and the yellow LED fades on, stays on for 1 second then turns off.
