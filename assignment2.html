            <h1>Alissa Acheson's Assignment 2!</h1>
            <p>
            For this assignment, my button and fade work, but not when uploaded via the same code file, after discussing in office hours, we think it was not due to the circuits/or code
                but potentially the arduino's capacity itself. When the code that is shown here is uploaded, the fading works but the button does not, but when only the buttons code is 
                uploaded the button works. Although they dont work at the same time, they are both operating correctly, and their individual operation is what is shown in my gifs. My assignment
                is also broken down into these two systems. 
            </p>

            Here are two angles of the circuits of the whole set up, these pictures were taken to highlight the button and green LED is is linked to. The button is in PIN 2, 5V, ground, and has a 10 k ohm resistor. 
            The LED is in PIN 13, and ground, and has a 220 ohm resistor.
