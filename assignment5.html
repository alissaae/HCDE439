            Above is the circuit that contains the IR reciever module and the LED strip LEDs, the LED strip is made up of 300 white LEDs, each set of 3 has a 240 ohm resistor. Not pictured is the IR remote that 
                communicates with the IR receiver module.

            <p>
            Above is the calculations for the amount of current used by the LEDs to justify the transistor use and the schematic of the circuits used. 
            </p>
<p>
    Below is the Ardunio code that the board is using, fading the LEDs on and off red when 5 is pressed and yellow when 2 is pressed.

/*
 * This code references this example

//calls the library IRremote
#include < IRremote.h >

//sets which pin the reciver is connected to
const int RECV_PIN = 7;
//tells the arduino which pin the IRrecv is connected to
IRrecv irrecv(RECV_PIN);
//defines a variable "results" of type decode_results
decode_results results;
//sets the pin the LED strip is connected to
const int stripPin = 9;



void setup(){
  // Start the receiver
  irrecv.enableIRIn();
  //tells the IRrecv object to flash the LED on and off when an IR signal is received. 
  irrecv.blink13(true);

  //sets the pin 9 connected to LED strip as output
  pinMode(stripPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop(){
    //using the function of decode, looks at variable "results"
    if (irrecv.decode(&results)){
          
        //accesses the part of results variable called value
        switch(results.value){
         //if the value reads as this case
          case 0xFF18E7: //Keypad button "2"
          
          //turn on strip pin via fade
          for (int fadeValue = 0 ; fadeValue <= 80; fadeValue += 5) {
              // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
              analogWrite(stripPin, fadeValue);
              //wait 30 milliseconds to see fade
              delay(30);
           }
          //wait 1 second
          delay(1000);


        }

        switch(results.value){
         //if the value reads as this case
          case 0xFF38C7: //Keypad button "5"
          

          //turn strip pin off
          digitalWrite(stripPin, LOW);


        }
   //recieve next value    
   irrecv.resume(); 
   }
}

    Below is the final operation, the gif shows the 2 button being pressed the LEDs fading on, then the 5 button being pressed and the LEDs switching off.
