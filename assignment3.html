            Above is the circuit that contains a photoresistor and 10k ohm resistor connected via A0, and a green LED with a 220 ohm resistor.

            Above is the calculations for the type of resistor used and the schematic of the circuits.

    Below is the Ardunio code that the board is using, making each LED blink. 
    Each LED blinks independently. Each line of code with content has a short comment explaining what the line does.

<pre><code>
//constant ints wont change, easier to change up pins
const int GreenPin = 13; //number of Green LED pin
const int YellowPin = 12; //number of Yellow LED pin
const int RedPin = 2; //number of Red LED pin


void setup() {
  
  pinMode(GreenPin, OUTPUT); //intialize pin 13 as an output, connected to power and ground
  pinMode(YellowPin, OUTPUT); //intialize pin 12 as an output, connected to power and ground
  pinMode(RedPin, OUTPUT); //intialize pin 2 as an output, connected to power and ground

}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(GreenPin, HIGH);   // turn LED on connect to power
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(GreenPin, LOW);    // turn the LED off connect to ground
  delay(500);               //wait for half a second

  digitalWrite(YellowPin, HIGH);   // turn LED on connect to power
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(YellowPin, LOW);    // turn the LED off connect to ground
  delay(500);               //wait for half a second

  digitalWrite(RedPin, HIGH);   // turn LED on connect to power
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(RedPin, LOW);    // turn the LED off connect to ground
  delay(500);               //wait for half a second
  

}

            Below is the final operation, using a GIF the lights blink on one second then turn off a half second, but they go in succession, looped to go on forever.
