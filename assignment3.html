            Above is the circuit that contains a photoresistor and 10k ohm resistor connected via A0, and a green LED with a 220 ohm resistor.

            <p>
            Above is the calculations for the type of resistors (220 and 10k) used and the schematic of the circuits.
            Also, the calcuation for the possible Vouts given the variating resistance of the photoresistor, using resistances measured using a multimeter (covering the photoresistor and then exposing it to a flashlight).
            </p>
<p>
    Below is the Ardunio code that the board is using, first calibrating to the environments light. This 
    is in set up, setting the minimum and maximum values. 
    Then the code to change and constrain those values into something the LED can understand (0-225), and finally, writing to the LED what to do.

            Below is the final operation, the gif on the left shoes the true function of the circuit,
            the LED turning on and off with the varying resistance of the photoresistor while the gif 
            on the right shows the built in LED (pin 13) light turning on during calibration as indicated in the code, 
            and turning off signalling an end to calibration, then the PIN 9 LED turns on as the code moves out of set up and into loop.
