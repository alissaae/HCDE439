            Above is the circuit that contains 3 LEDs, a green, yellow and red one. They are each limited with a 220 resistor.

            Above is the calculations for the type of resistor used and the schematic of the circuits.

//constant ints wont change, easier to change up pins
const int GreenPin = 13; //number of Green LED pin
const int YellowPin = 12; //number of Yellow LED pin
const int RedPin = 2; //number of Red LED pin


void setup() {
  
  pinMode(GreenPin, OUTPUT); //intialize pin 13 as an output, connected to power and ground
  pinMode(YellowPin, OUTPUT); //intialize pin 12 as an output, connected to power and ground
  pinMode(RedPin, OUTPUT); //intialize pin 2 as an output, connected to power and ground

}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(GreenPin, HIGH);   // turn LED on connect to power
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(GreenPin, LOW);    // turn the LED off connect to ground
  delay(500);               //wait for half a second

  digitalWrite(YellowPin, HIGH);   // turn LED on connect to power
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(YellowPin, LOW);    // turn the LED off connect to ground
  delay(500);               //wait for half a second

  digitalWrite(RedPin, HIGH);   // turn LED on connect to power
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(RedPin, LOW);    // turn the LED off connect to ground
  delay(500);               //wait for half a second

            Below is the final operation, using a GIF the lights blink on one second then turn off a half second, but they go in succession, looped to go on forever.
