            <p>
                My concept for this project was a lamp that would change brightness and would not need to be touched/or switched like a typical lamp. Initially my idea was to have it controlled by a
                IR reciever and remote, but the fading/timing needed for fading did not work with that piece of hardware. I pivoted instead to use an ultrasonic sensor where the distance of your hand from the lamp would determine 
                the brightness as well as turn it on and off.

            I 3D printed the shade with a thickness of 0.1 inches, and pillars for the LEDs to stick to. I also laser cut the box, with a panel in the middle for the lamp to sit on
                this panel has a hole for the LEDs to come through. The box also has a hole for the power and where the IR reciever was going to go. If I was going to do it again I would cut the 
                hole to fit the ultrasonic sensor inside.

    <h2>
    Arduino Code
</h2>
<p>
    Below is the code that runs the lamp. The lamp turns on/off when hand is within 5 cm of the sensor, when it turns on its at a default 50/255. 
    Once the lamp is on, the brightness can be changed by placing the hand within 30 cm of the sensor, Farther away -> more bright, Closer -> dimmer. 30 cm was chosen based on 
    my own testing, it works as a reasonable distance, too close and the lamp turns off, to far and other things may trigger the lamp. 
    There is also a delay between when the sensor can take a measurement, to prevent abrasive flashing. The distance measurements are also controlled for noise, taking 20 readings & removing the extremely low/high values (lowest 5 and highest 5) then
    averaging the middle 10.

    This is what the lamp looks like fully assembled, the front and back. The back being where the sensor and power source come out.
