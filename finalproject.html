                My concept for this project was a lamp that would change brightness and would not need to be touched/or switched like a typical lamp. Initially my idea was to have it controlled by a
                IR reciever and remote, but the fading/timing needed for fading did not work with that piece of hardware. I pivoted instead to use an ultrasonic sensor where the distance of your hand from the lamp would determine 
                the brightness as well as turn it on and off. 
            </p>

            Above is the circuit that contains the Ultrasonic sensor, the N-MOSTFET transitor, the arduino and lED strip. The 3 LED schematic is one of 100 on the strip.
